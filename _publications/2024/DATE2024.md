  Compute-in-Memory (CIM) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address the memory wall problem in modern computing systems. However, the lack of comprehensive toolchains for CIM macro development hinders its widespread adoption. This paper presents OpenC2, an open-source end-to-end hardware compiler development framework specifically designed for digital CIM macros. OpenC2 provides a complete toolchain from high-level algorithm descriptions to optimized CIM macro implementations, enabling rapid prototyping and design space exploration.
