  Design Rule Checking (DRC) is a critical step in the VLSI design flow that ensures manufacturability of integrated circuits. Traditional DRC tools face scalability challenges with increasing design complexity. This paper presents OpenDRC, an efficient open-source DRC engine that leverages hierarchical GPU acceleration to achieve significant performance improvements. Our approach utilizes the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs and hierarchical design representation to accelerate DRC operations while maintaining accuracy.
