  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown remarkable success in computer vision tasks, but their computational demands pose significant challenges for efficient deployment. This paper presents an optimization framework for heterogeneous Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures that leverages hybrid dataflow and in-network reduction techniques to accelerate ViT inference. Our approach addresses the unique computational patterns of ViTs by combining different dataflow strategies and implementing efficient reduction operations within the CIM network.
