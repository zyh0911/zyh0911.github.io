  Balancing scientific exposition and narrative engagement is a central challenge in science communication. To examine how to achieve balance, we conducted a formative study with four science communicators and a literature review of science communication practices, focusing on their workflows and strategies. These insights revealed how creators iteratively shift between exposition and engagement but often lack structured support. Building on this, we developed SpatialBalancing, a co-writing system that connects human spatial reasoning with the linguistic intelligence of large language models. The system visualizes revision trade-offs in a dual-axis space, where users select strategy-based labels to generate, compare, and refine versions during the revision process. This spatial externalization transforms revision into spatial navigation, enabling intentional iterations that balance scientific rigor with narrative appeal. In a within-subjects study (N=16), SpatialBalancing enhanced metacognitive reflection, flexibility, and creative exploration, demonstrating how coupling spatial reasoning with linguistic generation fosters monitoring in iterative science communication writing.
