  Visible light communication (VLC) systems require optimal LED placement to ensure uniform illumination and reliable communication. This paper presents a modified grey wolf optimization algorithm for designing symmetrical indoor visible light layouts. The proposed approach optimizes LED positioning to achieve balanced illumination distribution while maintaining communication quality, addressing the challenges of indoor VLC system design.
